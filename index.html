    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>
      This course is an introduction to front end web design and development
      using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and
      various software programs. The course consists of lectures and
      demonstrations on the design principles necessary to create an effective
      website as well as how to use code and other tools to bring it to life.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li> Throughout the semester we will be working towards developing unique,
          custom websites based on what we have been learning during lectures and
          demonstrations.</li>
          <li>  Students are expected to follow along with the
            demonstrations on their own computers. </li>
            <li>    There will be feedback sessions
              where students will present the rationale behind their work as well as
              working sessions to further hone the skills learned during demonstrations.</li>
      </ul>

     
    </p>

    <h2>Course Purpose and Learning Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Students will learn technical skills and conceptual practices required for
      modern web development and how to collaborate with web developers as a
      designer. This foundational course will provide a basic understanding of
      how web development works, the principles of good user experience and
      visual design on the web, and how to design and code with accessibility in
      mind. By the end of the course, students should be able to build a fully
      functioning front-end web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the rapid pace at which web standards and technologies evolve, the
      goal of this course is to give students a practical working knowledge of
      the latest and current design practices, as well as an understanding of
      the broader concepts involved. This will provide the tools and base
      knowledge required to remain up to date on the latest standards and
      practices going forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Classes with typically consist of time for lecture, group coding and design sessions, and then time for individual project work and troubleshooting
    </p>

    <h2>Course Project</h2>

    <p>
      Throughout the semester, students will be working to design and build their
      own website. The topic and design are up to you. By the end of the course, students will have developed a project brief, sitemap, 
      visual design, and code for their websites, which will be live online.
    </p>
